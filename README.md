# Claude Code Setup

My personal Claude Code configuration — skills, MCPs, plugins, methodology, and key bindings.
Designed to be shared across projects and team members.

---

## New Machine Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:tlempert/claude-setup.git ~/src/tal/claude-setup

# 2. Run the installer (symlinks everything into ~/.claude/)
cd ~/src/tal/claude-setup
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# 3. Fill in your secret(s)
#    Open ~/.claude/settings.json and set CORALOGIX_API_KEY

# 4. Install RTK (token optimizer)
cargo install rtk        # or: brew install rtk
rtk --version            # should print rtk x.y.z

# 5. Verify in Claude Code
#    Open Claude Code and type /describe — if it responds, skills are live
```

## Keeping Up to Date

When this repo changes (new skills, updated CLAUDE.md, etc.):

```bash
cd ~/src/tal/claude-setup
git pull
./install.sh   # re-runs safely — symlinks already in place, settings.json untouched
```

Because everything in `~/.claude/` is symlinked back to this repo, `git pull` is all you need — no manual file copying.

## Methodology: ATDD Pipeline

The workflow is built around **Acceptance Test-Driven Development** with a 5-pillar pipeline:

```
brainstorm-spec → write-gwt-spec → run-acceptance-pipeline → architecture-planning → scaffold-unit-tests → implementation → run-crap-analysis → run-mutation-test → enforce-dependencies
```

Core principles:

- **Ceiling first**: acceptance tests define observable behavior before any code
- **Floor next**: unit test stubs scaffold what must be proved
- **Guard dog**: mutation tests verify assertions, not just coverage
- **Walls**: dependency rules prevent layer tangling
- **Commit body is source of truth** — no MD files as design docs in the repo
- **Code review standard**: DHH + Uncle Bob lens before every commit
- **Test regressions**: prove old code fails first, then prove new code passes
- **Don't change shared method signatures** to accommodate one caller — use guards at call site
- **Keep changes minimal** — no abstractions for single-use sites

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
}

Query logs, traces, incidents, and alerts directly in Claude via Dataprime.

**Usage rules:**

- Always call `read_dataprime_intro_docs` before any query
- Always call `get_datetime` before any time-bounded query
- Query syntax: `source logs | filter $l.subsystemname == 'my-service'`
- Field prefixes: `$d` = user data, `$l` = labels, `$m` = metadata

## Hooks

Configured in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `hooks`.

### PreToolUse: rtk-rewrite

Rewrites all `Bash` commands through RTK (Rust Token Killer) for 60-90% token savings.

```json
{
  "matcher": "Bash",
  "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "/Users/<you>/.claude/hooks/rtk-rewrite.sh" }]
}
```

> Note: `~` is not expanded in `settings.json` — use the full absolute path.

### PreToolUse: backslash-mcp-guard

### PreToolUse + UserPromptSubmit: ccstatusline

Updates the status line in Claude Code UI on skill invocations and prompt submissions.

```json
{ "type": "command", "command": "npx -y ccstatusline@latest --hook" }
```

### RTK (Rust Token Killer)

`rtk` transparently proxies all CLI commands through a token-efficient filter.

```bash
rtk gain              # Show savings analytics
rtk gain --history    # Per-command usage history
rtk discover          # Find missed optimization opportunities
```

## Status Line

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "npx -y ccstatusline@latest",
    "padding": 0
  }
}
```

## Installation Notes

1. Install Claude Code CLI
2. Copy `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with your project's workflow rules
3. Add skills to `~/.claude/skills/` (each in its own folder with `SKILL.md`)
4. Configure `~/.claude/settings.json` with MCPs, plugins, hooks
